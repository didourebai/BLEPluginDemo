            <summary>
            we have to keep a reference to this because Android's api is weird and requires
            the GattServer in order to do nearly anything, including enumerating services

            <summary>
            we also track this because of gogole's weird API. the gatt callback is where
            we'll get notified when services are enumerated

            <summary>
            This method is only called by a user triggered disconnect.
            A user will first trigger _gatt.disconnect -> which in turn will trigger _gatt.Close() via the gattCallback

            <summary>
            CloseGatt is called by the gattCallback in case of user disconnect or a disconnect by signal loss or a connection error. 
            Cleares all cached services.
